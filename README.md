# Technical Interview Workshop
This repo contains the code from the Fall 2024 Computer Science Association Technical Interview Workshop held with the help of Keith Lea. In the premock directory, you will see the full (non-ideal) solution to the problem, found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1okDKWHf0k5n4zqTKYvVu0WFGSukP2g26?usp=drive_link). 

The mock interview was intentially _bad_ to have the aduience point out common flaws, such as the overengineered solution.
